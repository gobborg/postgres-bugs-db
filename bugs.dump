bi bot cronjob debugged	it wasn't running after i moved everything from homedir into a BonIverBot directory. i did update the cronjob filepath when I did this.	add line `os.chdir(os.path.dirname(__file__))` to change the directory to search for the read file in the same directory as the script's directory. tested it with the cronjob and it worked again.	presumably, cron did not change the working directory from the home directory to the script's directory	t	2021-08-01	2021-08-01	2	i don't have root view access to cronlog, and i couldn't figure out how to write cron log output to a diff .log file to view.	the script couldn't find the filepath to the sorted-lyrics.txt file even though it was in the same directory	`print(os.getdir())` to check which dir it was running out of. it was running out of the homedir (where it started) instead of the current dir.
clock switch statement wrong	UTC- timezones were wrong	change the switch statement cases 23-13 (descending) to be the appropriate timezones	timezones start from the prime meridian and the international dateline and expand hemispherically. i treated the globe as a complete circle that wraps all the way around.	t	2021-07-30	2021-07-30	5	fixed the .c and .js versions and reuploaded to archox	timezones NOVEMBER - XRAY were not mapped correctly	\N
